Win2VNC'
--------
Win2VNC is a great tool by Fredrik HÃ¼binette to use another computer's
monitor as a secondary monitor. It works by using VNC to control the
secondary monitor.

This patch aims to improve a few limitations of the original.

Implemented
-----------
- Support multimonitor client
- Disable clipboard sharing when working with an OS X host
  For some reason, the communication breaks down when clipboard is sent
  to the sharing host.
- Support mouse wheel
- Support meta key (mapped to Windows key)
  This will allow OS X hosts to receive 'Option' keystrokes.
